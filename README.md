## Learning Outcomes

- Completed 2 courses on Coursera namely:
    - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    - Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization, and Optimization
- Completed a tutorial that dealt with the basics of using the PyTorch framework to build machine learning models.
- Learned how to build a very basic neural network and use it to predict handwritten digits.
- Improved the neural network by introducing multiple layers of neurons which in turn increased the accuracy of the model.
- Learned about Convolution Neural Networks which are very useful in Image Processing.
- Built a model based on Convolution Neural Networks using the PyTorch framework to predict handwritten digits.
- The CNN model performed much better than the deep neural network model on the MNIST dataset.
- Read a research paper by Ian Goodfellow on [Generative Adversarial Nets](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf).
- Read a number of articles on Medium which explained Generative Adversarial Networks in greater detail.
- Understood the mathematics behind Generative Adversarial Networks.
- Implemented a basic Generative Adversarial Network using PyTorch framework which produced handwritten digits similar to those present in MNIST dataset.

## About Codes

The following codes were written and are added in the repositiory:

- MNIST Digit Recogniser: A model which predicted hand written digits when trained upon MNIST dataset. It used Convolutional Neural Networks for training.
- GAN implementation on MNIST: This model used Generative Adversarial Networks on MNIST dataset to produce similar handwritten digits. 
- Coursera Submissions: These are the codes submitted on coursera while completing the courses.
- Practice Codes: These are the practice models created while learning the PyTorch framework.
